# Blob api with adal example

This uses basically the same code as the RAM, so it should be easy to make it work there

`npm start`

Click on "Learn React" to start the auth flow and to list the blob containers for the archie backup storage account.

The first time you click you will need to log in / accept permissions probably.

Then the next time you click on it, it will use your cached permissions and work as expected
